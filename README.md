# Tic-Tac-Takehome - Take-Home Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to build a web-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** that supports real-time multiplayer functionality. We're looking for a well-structured, functional application that demonstrates your skills in both front-end and back-end development. Feel free to fork this repo or create your own public or private repo then give us access.

## Project Requirements

Your Tic-Tac-Toe application should meet the following core requirements:

### 1. Multiplayer Functionality

* **Real-time Interaction:** Users should be able to play against each other from different computers or devices.
* **Player Identification:** Players should be distinguishable (e.g., "Player X" and "Player O").

### 3. Back-End

* **State Management:** The server needs to maintain the state of ongoing games.
* **Real-time Communication:** Implement a mechanism for real-time communication with the front-end.
* **Technology Choice:** You have the freedom to choose your preferred back-end language/framework.

### 4. Code Quality & Structure

* **Modularity:** Organize your code into logical modules or components.
* **Readability:** Write clean, well-commented code.
* **Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run your project.
